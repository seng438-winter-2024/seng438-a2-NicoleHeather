# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

The planning and design for this lab was all done as a group before any Junit tests were written, all members also have gone over the introduction and instructions in the handout as well as downloading eclipse and starting their own project. By splitting up into pairs, we faciliate pair programming while also being more efficient in our use of time. We assign each pair a leader that is responsible for the coding and making pull requests to github, while the other maintains quiality control and documents the process in the lab report. For the classes and their testing execution themselves, we split Utilities and Range into sections for each pair to complete. Our chosen functions are as follows: 

DataUtilities:
| Methods                                                            | Functons being Tested
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------
| caclulateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column) : static double    | Correctness, throws excpetion when needed 
| calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row) : static double          | Correctness, throws excpetion when needed 
| createNumber(double[] data) : static java.lang.Numer[]             | Correctness, throws excpetion when needed 
| createNumberArray2D(double[][] data) : static java.lang.Number[][] | Correctness, throws excpetion when needed 
| getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data) : static KeyedValues    | Correctness, throws excpetion when needed 

Range:
| Methods                       | Functions Being Tested
|-------------------------------|------------------------
| getCentralValue() : double    | Correctness
| getLength() : double          | Correctness 
| getLowerBound() : double      | Correctness
| getUpperBound() : double      | Correctness
| toString() : java.lang.String | Correctness

Functionalities not be tested:
- User Interface 
- Efficency 
- Dependencies

Why we are choosing these Methods:
- Range:
   - These functions are relaivley simple but they are also the building blocks of many other methods and classes as they provide access to private data members. They can also provide avenues to test setters and constructors, so if they are inccorect then the whole system is compromised. 

- DataUtilities:
    - Arrays are a basic form a data structures that are crucial to the calculation and transfer of information, especially in regards to tables and graphing. In order to ensure that the output of these graphs and charts are correct the data from their base datasets must both provide the correct output, as well as throw the correct exceptions when needed.

# 3 Test cases developed

Range:
  - We first look at the possible edge case ranges along with the normal operating ranges, with 10 different cases. We then take each of these 10 cases and test our five selected methods against these ranges. For each test case (small, big, negative, positive) we will create one test method for each of the selected methods from the range class. Each test case will have their own test class and use the same range within that test case for all five test methods. The functon being tested will made clear by the names given. 

Partitions: * Alpha Numeric for 400
  - These methods moslty deal with legal input, this is becasue the constructor and other methods already check for the valid initalization. However that does not mean we cannot use unusual and specific values to test for the correctness of these functions.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

All work was completed and dsscussed as a group, due to all files being availible on github all members were able to contribute to the report. The testing plans themsevles were all carefully researched and disscussed before hand, and its implementation was done with all members present on one computer. Mmebers were split into pairs for efficiency.
