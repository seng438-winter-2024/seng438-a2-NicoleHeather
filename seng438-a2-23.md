# 1 Introduction

In the world of software design and testing, there are many methods used to ensure correctness but also provide developers with an efficient way to produce large scale testing modules. One of the more common tools is JUnit, a java based software that excels in large projects, mass data input and automated procedures. This labs purpose is to explore the design, planning and excution of JUnit test cases in blackbox testing, and how they can give a glimpse into the issues of code that cannot even be seen by the tester. 

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

The purpose of this testing strategy is to faciliate pair programming, organize resources, assign individual a well as group tasks 
Our chosen functions are as follows: 

DataUtilities:
| Methods                                                            | Functons being Tested                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| caclulateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column) : static double    | Correctness, throws exception when needed |
| calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row) : static double          | Correctness, throws exception when needed |
| createNumber(double[] data) : static java.lang.Numer[]             | Correctness, throws exception when needed |
| createNumberArray2D(double[][] data) : static java.lang.Number[][] | Correctness, throws exception when needed |
| getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data) : static KeyedValues    | Correctness, throws exception when needed |

Range:
| Methods                       | Functions Being Tested   |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| getCentralValue() : double    | Correctness, consistency |
| getLength() : double          | Correctness, consistency |
| getLowerBound() : double      | Correctness, consistency | 
| getUpperBound() : double      | Correctness, consistency |
| toString() : java.lang.String | Correctness, consistency | 

Blackbox Testing:
As per the instructions of the lab handout, this lab is done with blackbox testing stragtegies. This includes the creation of equivalence classes and partitions to orgganize each test case. For the class Range, there are three possible values that upper and lower can take, positive (X1), negative (X2) and zero (X3). Upper and lower are also separated by the constraint that upper must always be greater than lower. 

Partitions:

 - Range: The main partitions  being focused on for Range is the specific methods, input variables and output variables. So we will split these methods into individual classes in order to test all possible scenarios. All input ranges will follow a pattern of 10 different scenarios: both positive, both negative, one negative one positive, one zero one positive, one negative one zero, both zero, both equal positive, both equal negative, large range difference, small range difference. From the documentation provided on the range class, we know that the Range constructor doesn ot allow for any inputs that are not double, so checking illegal inputs cannot be testd in this class.

  | Test Case No. | Lower | Upper |
  |---------------|-------|-------|
  | 1. Both +     |  L1   |  U1   |   
  | 2. Both -     |  L2   |  U2   |
  | 3. - and +    |  L2   |  U1   |
  | 4. 0 and +    |  L3   |  U1   |
  | 5. - and 0    |  L2   |  U3   |
  | 6. Both 0     |  L3   |  U3   |
  | 7. + = +      |  L1   |  U1   |
  | 8. - = -      |  L2   |  U2   |
  | 9. big diff   |  L2   |  U1   |
  | 10.small diff |  L1   |  U1   |

 - DataUtilities: The partitions for the DataUtilities classes tests various inputs including valid values, large valid values, small valid values, an empty array, null data, and invalid data. We created tests to see if the InvalidParameterException is thrown when null or invalid data is passed. Additionally, calculateColumnTotal and calculateRowTotal have tests for varying input amounts. Mocking played a large role in the testing of calculateColumnTotal, calculateRowTotal, and getCumulativePercentages, as all three methods required dependencies that needed to be simulated, specifically Values2D and KeyedValues. Mocking was needed in order to test the relevant partitions that required these object types.


Functionalities not being tested:
- Hardware interface
- Database logic
- Communication interface
- User interface and communication
- Security
- Performance

Why we are choosing these Methods:

- Range:
   - These functions are relatively simple but they are also the building blocks of many other methods and classes as they provide access to private data members. They can also provide avenues to test setters and constructors, so if they are inccorect then the whole system is compromised. 

- DataUtilities:
    - Arrays are a basic form a data structures that are crucial to the calculation and transfer of information, especially in regards to tables and graphing. In order to ensure that the output of these graphs and charts are correct the data from their base datasets must both provide the correct output, as well as throw the correct exceptions when needed. 

Test Type:

The main styles of testing being used are both JUnit creation and Blackbox testing. This means that the only source of information we have on the code provided is the javadoc information.
 - Integration - Testing units will be split and made individually, eventually coming together on a single system in the end. 

Test Objective:

The main objectives of these tests is to confirm the functionality and correctness of these chosen functions. However these goals are not limited to basic outputs and values, but rather the different kinds of scenarios these methods can be executed in. For example, toString() might be able to return a strting that is correct for values that are floats, but since we are unaware of the actual code used to create this function it might fail to produce the correct results for an integer range. This shows that while the function may return the correct values, it is not consistent with that said correctness.

Limitatons and Concerns: 

The main limitation that we must plan around is the fact that we are doing black box testing, meaning we have no access to the code. During the creation and execution fo the JUnit tests we have to trust that the requirements outlined in the documentation are met by the current code. As a result, our testing should cover every single possible input and output for a single function. Even if one scenario of input works or doesn't, that does not mean that there is not some hidden implementation or logic that could possibly cause either failure or success for different inputs. 

****Include a discussion about what you feel are the benefits and drawbacks about using mocking****

Who and When:
The creation and execution of the JUnit module begins only after the planning phase is nearly complete, all member participate in the organization and distribution of tasks along with their timeframe. There are exceptions made for unforeseen circumstances.

# 3 Test cases developed

Range Equivalent Classes:
  - We first look at the possible edge case ranges along with the normal operating ranges, with 10 different cases. We then take each of these 10 cases and test our five selected methods against these ranges. For each test case (small, big, negative, positive) we will create one test method for each of the selected methods from the range class. Each test case will have its own test class and use the same range within that test case for all five test methods. The function being tested will made clear by the names given.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

All work was completed and discussed as a group, due to all files being availible on github all members were able to contribute to the report. The testing plans themselves were all carefully researched and discussed beforehand, and its implementation was done with all members present on one computer. Members were split into pairs for efficiency. A pair of two was assigned a class to write tests for, within those groups the work would be divided with one member taking on more classes while the other made up for it in documentation in the lab-report. At the end all four members came together for the final review and implementation into a whole program.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

There were some difficulties with the panning and design of the test cases themselves, since very few of us have made our own JUnit test to this scale. Ensuring that we had tests that met the requirements in the handout took some time to discuss and deliberate on. The biggest lesson that we took from this lab is the intricacies and time that it takes to properly execute JUnit cases, it is important to understand that these test cases should do their best to cover all kinds of inputs and functions 

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

We feel like this was a good lab that demonstrated the usefulness and ease at which JUnit can be used, even with code you did not have access to. JUnit is a pretty simple tool to use, the only issues is just the design phase can be difficult if some requirements are not fully understood. The freedom to choose which functions to create tests for in Range provided a little more freedom for use to explore and come up with out own ideas. However, the DataUtilities functions being already chosen did also give us a challenge to overcome.
